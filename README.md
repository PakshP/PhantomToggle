2. **Place in Plugins Folder:** Place the `PhantomToggle.jar` file in your server's `plugins` directory.
3. **Restart the Server:** Start or restart your Minecraft server. The plugin will be loaded automatically.
4. **Enjoy:** Players can now use the `/togglephantoms` command to toggle phantom spawning for themselves.
